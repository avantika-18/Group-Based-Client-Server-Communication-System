# Group-Based-Client-Server-Communication-System

As part of a group project in the module 'COMP1549: Advanced Programming', we have been assigned to create a client-server communication system, which has been implemented to demonstrate the use of design patterns, as well as using JUnit to evaluate the project. Moreover, it is able to demonstrate the understanding of the Java programming language. 

The project is able to demonstrate the following:

1. When a new user has joined/connected the system, they are able to provide a unique ID, as well as the server's IP address.
2. If the member join the chat, the system will notify that the user has entered the server, and the first person to join the server is assigned coordinator (admin of chat)
3. If the current coordinator leaves, then any member has been assigned as the new coordinator
4. Everyone is able to view who is in the current chat, and has the option to select that user to private message
